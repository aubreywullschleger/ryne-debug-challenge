			<h2>My Hometown</h2>
			<p> I grew up in Crown Point, IN, about 40 miles SE of Chicago. One of my favorite pastimes is hanging out with my family on their 20 acre organic farm.

			<h2>I'm not a Native, but I made it here as soon as I could</h2>
			<p class= "bikes">Following the Peace Corps, my partner and I wanted to start our lives in a new locale and so we moved to Denver. Since then, I've worked at a Non Profit that supports bicyclists. If you ever want to go for a ride sometime or need help fixin' your bike, let me know!</p>  
			<p> In my free time, I love to explore Colorado and the Southwest. I love biking of all sorts, hiking, camping, etc. </p>
